# donate-product-client

This is the client part for the Donate Product component. Through it you can include a product donation on your site. From the donor of the donation, you will receive a client key that is made especially for you.
If you have WooCommerce integrated then the donated product will appear on the checkout page above the total.
If you don't have WooCommerce integrated then the component generates a "Donate Now" button that takes the customer directly to the donor page where they can make the donation.
